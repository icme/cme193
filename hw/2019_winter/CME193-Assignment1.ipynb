    "# CME193 - Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will be learning about and implementing [Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain), if you have never heard  of them before, do not worry, this notebook will explain everything needed for the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov chains\n",
    "The best way to introduce what a Markov chain is with a simple example. Suppose you have a simple counter that you can set to any number between 1 and 10 (including 1 and 10). At every step you roll a standard 6 -sided die and depending on whether the rolled number is even or odd you either increment or decrement the counter. If you try to increment at 10, lets say it wraps around to 0 and similarly for trying to decrement at 0. Now you can play this game for multiple steps and record the counter value after every step, this is just a simple markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example evolution of the markov chain,\n",
    "Start with counter at 1.\n",
    "- Step 1 : Roll a 4, its even so increment the counter to 2.\n",
    "- Step 2 : Roll a 2, its even so increment the counter to 3.\n",
    "- Step 3 : Roll a 5, its odd so decrement the counter to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A markov chain consists of a set of n states (in our example it was the 10 states of the counter) and a probabilistic rule to jump to another state every step (the dice rolls). Although in our simple example we had a similar rule for each state, you can have a different rule for each state. For example you may say that if you the counter is odd, dont roll a die, always increment, and follow the die for even states. The rule is always in the form of n probabilities that sum to one. Each probability indicates the chance that it jump to that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example the rule for state 1 can be represented by this numpy vector"

    "\n",
    "Write a function to return the transition matrix for the following markov chain, given the number of states as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule for the markov chain is as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "If current state is i\n",
    "1. With probability 0.8, it goes to state i+1\n",
    "2. With probability 0.2, it will fall back to state i = 0.\n",
    "3. At state n-1, since it cannot go higher, with probability 1 it stays in the same state of n-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this markov chain behaves in the following way, at every step there is an 80% chance that it climbs up by 1 and 20% chance that it falls down completely, howeverif it does reach the final state n-1, it stays there forever\n",
    "\n",
    "You are **not** allowed to use any for loops for this question, instead use numpy indexing to fill in your matrix. You can assume that n is atleast 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "1. First write your code in an empty cell for with a hardcoded n value, in this way you can quickly iterate and get the right answer first. Then copy it into the function.\n",
    "2. You can use [Array indexing](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.indexing.html#index-arrays)"

    "\n",
    "Luckily this is fairly easy to calculate, using matrix multiplication. An amazingly useful property of the transition matrix is as follows, if you have vector $p_j$ as the vector of probabilites after step $j$, then $p_{j+1}$ is given by the following matrix vector product.\n",
