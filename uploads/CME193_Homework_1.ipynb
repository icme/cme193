    "In this assignment, you'll be implementing and exploring properties of [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). Don't worry if you aren't familiar with them -- this notebook will explain everything needed for the assignment.\n",

    "## Markov chains\n",
    "Markov chains are simple systems that are described by probabilistic rules at each time step. The best way to introduce Markov chains is with a simple example. Suppose we have a simple counter that can be set to any number between 0 and 5, including 0 and 5. It starts at some number, say 0. At every step, you flip a coin: if it is heads, then the counter increases by 1, and if it is tails, then the counter decreases by 1. The counter doesn't change if the counter is at 0 and we flip tails or if it is at 5 and we flip heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example instance of this Markov chain:\n",
    " - Step 0. The counter is at 0.\n",
    " - Step 1. The coin lands on tails; the counter remains at 0.\n",
    " - Step 2. The coin lands on heads; the counter increases to 1.\n",
    " - Step 3. The coin lands on heads; the counter increases to 2.\n",
    " - Step 4. The coin lands on tails; the counter decreases to 1.\n",
    " - ...and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a Markov chain like this consists of a set of $n$ states (in our example, it is the 6 possible states of the counter), as well as probabilistic rules that indicates the probability of landing in each of the different states after each step. The rule, one for each state, consists of $n$ probabilities that sum to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the counter is currently set to 3, the rule would be represented by the vector\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0.5 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0.5 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is because after the next step, we have 0 probability of ending up in state 0, 0 probability of state 1, 0.5 probability of state 2, 0 probability of state 3, 0.5 probability of state 4, and so on.\n",

If the current state is $n-1$, then it stays in the same state of $n-1$ (with probability 1). Otherwise, if current state is $i$, with probability 0.8, it goes to state $i+1$, and with probability 0.2, it falls back to state $i = 0$. Intuitively, at every step there is an 80% chance that it climbs up by 1, but a 20% chance that it falls down all the way. However, if it does reach the state $n-1$, it stays there forever.\n",

That is, the $i$th entry of $p_j$ is the probability that the state is $i$ at step $j$. Then if $T$ is the transition matrix, then $p_{j+1}$ is related to $p_j$ by the following matrix vector product:\n",
