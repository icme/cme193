    "In this assignment, you'll be analyzing an interesting dataset: the passengers of the ship *Titanic*. As you are probably familiar, the *Titanic* was a ship that collided with an iceberg on April 15, 1912 and sank. About one-third of the passengers survived. We are interested in analyzing what factors are correlated with whether a person survived (whether the person was traveling with family, the person's sex, the person's age, etc.)."
