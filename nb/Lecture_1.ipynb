To start up this notebook, from a terminal, `cd` to the directory you want to be in, and start up a notebook server using `jupyter notebook`.

    "# Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point, you may run into a situation where different projects require different versions of the same package.  One way to manage this is through virtual environments.  This also has the benefit of allowing others to reproduce the state of your system, and (ideally) makes your code/projects reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to cover how to do this with Anaconda python, using `conda`, but you can also do this using `pipenv` or `virtualenv` - for example, see [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the documentation for managing environments using `conda` [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create your environment\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name cme193 python=3.6\n",
    "```\n",
    "`cme193` is the name of our virtual environment.  `python=3.6` indicates that we are going to use this specific version of python.  Generally you can specify which versions of packages should be used in your environment this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Activate your environment\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source activate cme193\n",
    "```\n",
    "to deactivate an environment, you can use\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source deactivate cme193\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install packages and run python as you usually would\n",

    "conda install numpy # can also use pip\n",
    "conda install scipy\n",
    "conda install matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Environments are something you *really* should use, but because there are a variety of ways to do this in practice, we're not going to enforce that you do it any particular way.  Sometimes you may see a reference to this process in lecture or homework, and if you're not using `conda` to manage environments, just translate the statements into your situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final comment on environments - you have now seen the (minimal) basics.  If you think there's something environments should reasonably do, chances are that you can actually do it.  In particular, automating the setup of environments using environment files is something you may one day wish to use to share your work."
