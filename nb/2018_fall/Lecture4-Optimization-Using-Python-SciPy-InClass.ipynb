    "Given an (undirected) **complete bipartite graph** $G = (V_1, V_2, E)$, with an edge cost function $C : E \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, the goal is to find a minimum weight **matching** $M \\subset E$ that covers the smaller of the two sets $V_1$ or $V_2$. Thus $V_1$ and $V_2$ need not be of the same sizes. $G$ being complete bipartite graph means that there is an edge $e \\in E$ between every pair of vertices $v_1 \\in V_1$, and $v_2 \\in V_2$. A matching refers to a selection of edges such that no vertex is covered more than once. This problem is also known as the **linear sum assignment** problem.\n",

All the algorithms require an initial guess (or starting point) $x_0$. The syntax for the function ```scipy.optimize.root``` can be found <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.root.html#scipy.optimize.root\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">here</a>.\n",

    "- ```method```: The type of solver to use. Options include ```hybr```, ```krylov```, ```broyden1``` etc.\n",

    "Before we get to solving some real optimization problems, we need to understand some of the important parameters that the method ```scipy.optimize.minimize``` accepts. The detailed documentation can be found on the <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html#scipy.optimize.minimize\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">documentation page</a> of the method. The important parameters that you must be aware of are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```fun```: A function that implements $f$. It accepts $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and returns $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The function can optionally return the Jacobian as well.\n",
    "- ```x0```: Initial guess of a local minimizer.\n",
    "- ```method```: The type of solver to use, explained in the next section.\n",
    "- ```jac```: It can be a function that returns the Jacobian of $f$. In this case, it must accept the same arguments as fun. The Jacobian may also be estimated using finite difference schemes such as ```2-point```, ```3-point```, or ```cs```. If ```jac``` is a Boolean and is ```True```, ```fun``` is assumed to return the Jacobian along with the objective function. If ```False```, the gradient will be estimated using ```2-point``` finite difference estimation.\n",
    "- ```hess```: A function for computing the Hessian matrix of $f$. Similar to ```jac```, it can also be estimated using the same finite difference schemes. Read the documentation for more details.\n",
    "- ```hessp```: A function that implements the action of the Hessian of the objective function on an arbitrary vector. Note that only one of ```hess``` or ```hessp``` must be provided. If both are provided, this parameter is ignored.\n",
    "- ```bounds```: Must be an instance of the class ```scipy.optimize.Bounds``` as described in last section.\n",
    "- ```constraints```: This parameter is only used when the ```method``` is either ```trust-constr```, ```COBYLA``` or ```SLSQP```. For ```trust-constr```, the constraints must be specified as a list of objects of type ```scipy.optimize.LinearConstraint``` or ```scipy.optimize.NonlinearConstraint```. For the other two methods, the constraints must be specified as dictionaries, and you should read the documentation if you want to ue them.\n",
    "- ```options```: A dictionary with optional arguments for the solver ```method```.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that is important to note here to avoid confusion is that the Jacobian of the function $f$ is nothing but the gradient of $f$, which is exactly what ```jac``` needs to calculate.\n",

While Quasi-Newton methods estimate the Hessian from the gradient, and thus do not strictly need an implementation of the Hessian to be supplied, we will group them under second-order methods.
